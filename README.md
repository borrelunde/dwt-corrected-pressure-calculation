# Deadweight Tester Corrected Pressure Calculation

The Jupyter Notebook calculates the corrected pressure using the formula provided in the [OM20594 Deadweight Tester User Manual](./docs/OM20594-user-manual-deadweight-tester.pdf): Temperature and Gravity Corrections.

It is calculated based on the actual pressure, local temperature, calibrated temperature for the deadweight tester, calibrated gravitational acceleration for the deadweight tester (here, standard gravitational acceleration), and local gravitational acceleration.
